**Hollywood Consumer Insights in Lahore**

As part of my course on Data Science, my group undertook the task of collecting raw data and converting it into insights.

Our primary data collection was through surveys conducted using Google Forms. Our cleaning stage and EDA was implemented first through Excel to give us an idea as simple beginners and then we transitioned into working with Pandas and Numpy. 

We then implemented and tested multiple machine learning approaches for our movie recommender model.

Also created a [blog](https://medium.com/@aman.ahmed259003/decoding-preferences-a-deep-dive-into-hollywood-movie-consumer-insights-in-lahore-b5c82be3ad98) on Medium, that detailed the project's work and findings.
